Command Executor:

todo: use Command string value bug {
    
    use "Hello World"
    print

    only prints Hell
    we need to replace string.split(' ') with something that
    doesnt fuck up the string
}

todo: use Command {

    use Transform Vector3 100 39 0 Vector3 1 Quaternion

    all of the values here is interperated as 
    Transform constructor arguments
    
    fix:
    use Transform (Vector3 (100, 3, 4), Vector3 (1), Quaternion (329, 21, 1, 1))
    
    comma sepperated arguments

}

todo: semicolon syntax {
    commands can get really long. we should be able to have on command on several lines
    how do we sepperate commands from each other?
    fix:
    use semicolon after every command
}


Animation libray:

todo: class Curve2D {
    represents a curve on a graph

    api:
    list<value, time>
    float Evaluate(time) {
        return value at time
    }

    would be cool with intuitive chainable api for creating a curve in code
}

todo: class Animation {
    
    things to figure out:

    what needs animating?
     - GameObjects?
     - RenderObjects?

    how do we get animations from blender?

    

}


Assets:

todo: Assets auto loading {
    all assets should be loaded without me telling them to be loaded
}
<Done> todo: shader assets {
    deffine vertex, fragment etc shaders in one "shaderProgram" file
    so we dont need to use loadShaderAsset(name, vertex, fragment) 

    to figure out:
    can we create PShaders from strings // yes it seem like it
}


General:

todo: file path sepperator {
    find the path sepperator to get correct file paths on both windows, linux, mac
}
